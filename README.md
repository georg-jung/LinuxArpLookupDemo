# Lib: [ArpLookup](https://github.com/georg-jung/ArpLookup)

Based on the method evaluated here I created a cross-platform (windows + linux) arp ip-mac-lookup library. Just use https://github.com/georg-jung/ArpLookup if you are interested in .Net Standard cross-platform lookups. The library uses the same principle that the demo in this repository makes use of.
